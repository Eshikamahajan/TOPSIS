A multi-criteria decision analysis method
TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution'.As the name implies, the method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those
This proposed technique can be highly useful in large scale decision-making problems as often found in aeronautic and automotive industries.
